Overview
This directory contains code related to the orthographic
implementation of jitternet. This implementation of
jitternet seeks to autoencode position-invariant features
of orthographic wordforms for use in subsequent modeling
exercises. It takes a jittered orthographic input as inputs,
and maps that input to a stable orthographic output, via
one or several hidden layers.
